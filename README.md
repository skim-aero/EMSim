# EMSim: Ellipsoidal Methods Simulation
## 1. Software Introduction
This is the simulation code for the comparison of ellipsoidal methods for multi-sensor fusion. It includes Bar-Shalom/Campo (BC), comvex combination (CC), covariance intersection (CI), set theoretic estimation (STE), iverse covariance intersection (ICI), largest ellipsoid (IE) method, internall ellipsoid approximation (IEA) method, and ellipsoidal intersection (EI).

For the detail of the algorithms/methods, please refer to the original papers follows:
