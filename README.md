This is the simulation code for the comparison of ellipsoidal methods for multi-sensor fusion.

It includes Bar-Shalom/Campo (BC), comvex combination (CC), covariance intersection (CI), set theoretic estimation (STE), iverse covariance intersection (ICI), largest ellipsoid (IE) method, internall ellipsoid approximation (IEA) method, and ellipsoidal intersection (EI).
